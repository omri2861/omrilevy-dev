[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) claims to be "The world's fastest framework for
building websites".

I chose it as a starter, because it was recommended by
[fireship.io](https://fireship.io), and because it's built on markdown (which
I'm a huge fan of - who isn't?).

Really, for me it's just a simple way to build my blog with no dependencies,
easy deployment, and text based configuration and content.

Hugo does just that, using a single `hugo` binary. However, I already see that
they vary from the default vanilla markdown _by default_, which is a _huge_
letdown.

We'll see how it goes.
